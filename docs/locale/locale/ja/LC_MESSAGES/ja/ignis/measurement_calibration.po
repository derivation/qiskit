"The idea of measurement calibration and mitigation is to calibrate "
"measurement errors via a series of basis state measurements and then "
"apply that calibration to correct the average results of another "
"experiment of interest. In the most general case we need to calibrate all"
" :math:`2^n` basis states. If the measurement noise is uncorrelated "
"between qubit subsets we only need prepare the full basis states in those"
" subsets and measure the outcome states. The first we call the complete "
"measurement and the latter the tensored measurement."
