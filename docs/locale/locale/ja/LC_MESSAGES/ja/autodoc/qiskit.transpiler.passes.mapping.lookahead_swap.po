"The role of the mapper pass is to modify the starting circuit to be "
"compatible with the target device's topology (the set of two-qubit gates "
"available on the hardware.) To do this, the mapper will insert SWAP gates"
" to relocate the virtual qubits for each upcoming gate onto a set of "
"coupled physical qubits. However, as SWAP gates are particularly lossy, "
"the goal is to accomplish this remapping while introducing the fewest "
"possible additional SWAPs."
