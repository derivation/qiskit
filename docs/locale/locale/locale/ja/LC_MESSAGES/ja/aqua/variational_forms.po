"In quantum mechanics, the *variational method* is one way of finding "
"approximations to the lowest energy eigenstate, or *ground state*, and "
"some excited states. This allows calculating approximate wave functions, "
"such as molecular orbitals.  The basis for this method is the "
"*variational principle*."

"The variational method consists of choosing a *trial wave function*, or "
"*variational form*, that depends on one or more parameters, and finding "
"the values of these parameters for which the expectation value of the "
"energy is the lowest possible.  The wave function obtained by fixing the "
"parameters to such values is then an approximation to the ground state "
"wave function, and the expectation value of the energy in that state is "
"an upper bound to the ground state energy. Quantum variational "
"algorithms, such as :ref:`vqe`, apply the variational method. As such, "
"they require a variational form."

"Consistent with its unique  design, Aqua has a modular and extensible "

"with a variational form, for the case of none of qubits are unentangled "
"to other qubits, the number of optimizer parameters SwapRz creates and "
"uses is given by :math:`q + d \\times \\left(q + "
"\\sum_{k=0}^{q-1}|D(k)|\\right)`, where :math:`|D(k)|` denotes the "
"*cardinality* of :math:`D(k)` or, more precisely, the *length* of "
":math:`D(k)` (since :math:`D(k)` is not just a set, but a list). "
"Nonetheless, in some cases, if an ``entangler_map`` does not include all "
"qubits, that is, some qubits are not entangled by other qubits. The "
"number of parameters is reduced by :math:`d \\times q' ` where :math:`q'`"
" is the number of unentangled qubits. This is because adding more Rz "
"gates to the unentangled qubits only introduce overhead without bring any"
" benefit; furthermore, theroetically, applying multiple Rz gates in a row"
" can be reduced to one Rz gate with the summed rotation angles."
