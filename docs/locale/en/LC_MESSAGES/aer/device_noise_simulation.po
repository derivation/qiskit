"The *basic device noise model* we used for our simulation is a simplified"
" error model that only takes into account *local* errors occuring on the "
"qubits participating in each individual gate, and treats the erors as a "
"relaxation process combined with an error operation which acts to "
"randomize the state of the qubit with some probability *p* (the "
"depolarizing probability). While this model is an approximation, due to "
"its simplicity it is a useful starting point for studying the effects of "
"noise on quantum computations."
