"When using Qiskit Terra there are several aspects of the library where "
"Terra has opinionated defaults. These defaults are normally in the "
"interest of supporting the least common demonitator between users. For "
"example, the default backend for "
"``qiskit.visualization.circuit_drawer()``/``QuantumCircuit.draw()`` is "
"the text backend. However, depending on your local environment you may "
"want to change these defaults to something better suited for your use "
"case. This is what the user config file can be used for. It lets you "
"optionally specify local defaults for these things"

"By default the user config file should be located in "

"supported option, ``circuit_drawer`` which is used to set the default "
"backend used when running the circuit drawer."

"In this file when you call the circuit drawer the default output will be "

"``mpl``, ``latex``, and ``latex_source``. These are the only valid values"
