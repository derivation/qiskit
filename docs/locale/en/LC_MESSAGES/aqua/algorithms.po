"A key concept in classification methods is that of a kernel. Data cannot "

"linear transformation function to the data. This function is called a "
"*feature map*, as it transforms the raw features, or measurable "

"including the raw original one – is nothing more than seeing how close "
"data points are to each other. This is the same as computing the inner "
"product for each pair of data in the set. In fact we do not need to "
"compute the non-linear feature map for each datum, but only the inner "
