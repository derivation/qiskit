" quantum circuits - quantum neural network. Furthermore, neural networks "

"Consistent with its unique design, Aqua has a modular and extensible "
"architecture. Algorithms and their supporting objects, such as feature-"
"map techniques for Artificial Intelligence, are pluggable modules in "
"Aqua. New feature maps are typically installed in the "
"``qiskit_aqua/components/neural_networks`` folder and derive from the "
"``DiscriminativeNetwork`` class for neural networks that are supposed to "
"perform discriminative tasks and the ``GenerativeNetwork`` class for "
"neural networks that are supposed to perform generative tasks. Aqua also "
"allows for :ref:`aqua-dynamically-discovered-components`: new components "
"can register themselves as Aqua extensions and be dynamically discovered "
"at run time independent of their location in the file system. This is "
"done in order to encourage researchers and developers interested in :ref"
":`aqua-extending` to extend the Aqua framework with their novel research "
"contributions."
