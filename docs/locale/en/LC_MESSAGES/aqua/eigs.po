"Aqua bundles methods to find Eigenvalues of a given matrix, such as "
":ref:`eigsqpe_component` in the Eigs library. Rather than being used as a"
" standalone algorithm, the members of the library are to be used in a "
"larger algorithm such as :ref:`HHL`. The following methods are available"

":ref:`eigsqpe_component`: Given a matrix and a linear combination of its "
"eigenstates, *QPE* prepares the Eigenvalues on a specified output "
"register."

"Consistent with its unique  design, Aqua has a modular and extensible "
"architecture. Algorithms and their supporting objects, such as optimizers"
" for quantum variational algorithms, are pluggable modules in Aqua. New "
"eigenvalue solvers are typically installed in the "
"``qiskit_aqua/components/eigs`` folder and derive from the "
"``Eigenvalues`` class.  Aqua also allows for :ref:`aqua-dynamically-"
"discovered-components`: new Eigenvalue estimator can register themselves "
"as Aqua extensions and be dynamically discovered at run time independent "
"of their location in the file system. This is done in order to encourage "
"researchers and developers interested in :ref:`aqua-extending` to extend "
"the Aqua framework with their novel research contributions."

"This Eigenvalue solver component is directly based on the QPE quantum "
"algorithm in Aqua :ref:`qpe`. Some changes have been made to support "
"negative eigenvalues and use it in a larger quantum algorithm (e.g. "
