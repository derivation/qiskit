"Pass to consolidate sequences of uninterrupted gates acting on the same "
"qubits into a Unitary node, to be resynthesized later, to a potentially "
"more optimal subcircuit. Important note: this pass assumes that the "
"'blocks_list' property that it reads is given such that blocks are in "
"topological order."
