"Qiskit is an open-source framework for working with noisy quantum "
"computers at the level of pulses, circuits, and algorithms."
msgstr ""

#: ../../overview.rst:8
msgid ""
"Certainly, a central goal of Qiskit is to build a software stack that "
"makes it easy for anyone to use quantum computers. However, Qiskit also "
"aims to facilitate research on the most important open issues facing "
"quantum computation today."

"Qiskit consists of four foundational elements:  Terra (the code "
"foundation, for composing quantum programs at the level of circuits and "
"pulses), Aqua (for building algorithms and applications), Ignis (for "
"addressing noise and errors), and Aer (for accelerating development via "
"simulators, emulators and debuggers)."

msgid ""
"Terra , the ‘earth’ element, is the foundation on which the rest of "
"Qiskit lies. Terra provides a bedrock for composing quantum programs at "
"the level of circuits and pulses, to optimize them for the constraints of"
" a particular device, and to manage the execution of batches of "
"experiments on remote-access devices. Terra defines the interfaces for a "
"desirable end-user experience, as well as the efficient handling of "
"layers of optimization, pulse scheduling and backend communication."

msgstr ""

#: ../../overview.rst:41
msgid ""
"Aer, the ‘air’ element, permeates all Qiskit elements. To really speed up"
" development of quantum computers we need better simulators, emulators "
"and debuggers.  Aer will help us understand the limits of classical "
"processors by demonstrating to what extent they can mimic quantum "
"computation. Furthermore, we can use Aer to verify that current and near-"
"future quantum computers function correctly. This can be done by "
"stretching the limits of simulation, and by simulating the effects of "
"realistic noise on the computation."

msgid "Qiskit Ignis"
msgstr ""

#: ../../overview.rst:52
msgid ""
"Ignis, the ‘fire’ element, is dedicated to fighting noise and errors and "
"to forging a new path. This includes better characterization of errors, "
"improving gates, and computing in the presence of noise. Ignis is meant "
"for those who want to design quantum error correction codes, or who wish "
"to study ways to characterize errors through methods such as tomography, "
"or even to find a better way for using gates by exploring dynamical "
"decoupling and optimal control."

msgstr ""

#: ../../overview.rst:62
msgid ""
"Aqua, the ‘water’ element, is the element of life. To make quantum "
"computing live up to its expectations, we need to find real-world "
"applications. Aqua is where algorithms for NISQ computers are built. "
"These algorithms can be used to build applications for quantum computing."
" Aqua is accessible to domain experts in chemistry, optimization or AI, "
"who want to explore the benefits of using quantum computers as "
"accelerators for specific computational tasks, without needing to worry "
"about how to translate the problem into the language of quantum machines."

"Qiskit Chemistry extends the Aqua element to allow the user to work "
"easier with quantum computing for quantum chemistry problem. Is a set of "
"tools, algorithms and software to use for quantum chemistry research. "
"Qiskit Chemistry comes with interfaces prebuilt for the following four "
"computational chemistry software drivers: Gaussian™ 16 (a commercial "
"chemistry program), PSI4 (an open-source chemistry program built on "
"Python), PySCF (an open-source Python chemistry program), and PyQuante (a"
" pure Python cross-platform open-source chemistry program)."
