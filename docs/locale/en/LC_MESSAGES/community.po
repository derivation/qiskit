"Qiskit has been designed with modularity in mind. It is extensible in "
"many different ways; on the page, we highlight the ways in which the "
"Qiskit community has engaged with Qiskit and developed extensions and "
"packages on top of it."

"The Qiskit base provider is an entity that provides access to a group of "
"different backends (for example, backends available through IBM Q). It "
"interacts with those backends to do many things: find out which ones are "
"available, retrieve an instance of a particular backend, get backend "
"properties and configurations, and handling running and working with "
"jobs."

#: ../../community.rst:45
msgid ""
"Circuit optimization is at the heart of making quantum computing feasible"
" on actual hardware. A central component of Qiskit is the transpiler, "
"which is a framework for manipulating quantum circuits according to "
"certain transformations (known as transpiler passes). The transpiler "
"enables users to create customized sets of passes, orchestrated by a pass"
" manager, to transform the circuit according to the rules specified by "
"the passes. In addition, the transpiler architecture is designed for "
"modularity and extensibility, enabling Qiskit users to write their own "
"passes, use them in the pass manager, and combine them with existing "
"passes. In this way, the transpiler architecture opens up the door for "
"research into aggressive optimization of quantum circuits."
