"A framework for characterizing and mitigating noise in quantum circuits "
"and devices."
msgstr ""

#: ../../ignis/overview.rst:11
msgid ""
"Ignis provides code for users to easily generate circuits for specific "
"experiments given a minimal set of user input parameters. Ignis code "
"contains three fundamental building blocks: circuits, fitters and "
"filters."
msgstr ""

#: ../../ignis/overview.rst:18
msgid ""
"The circuits module provides the code to generate the list of circuits "
"for a particular Ignis experiment based on a minimal set of user "
"parameters. These are then run on Terra or Aer."
msgstr ""

msgid "Fitters"
msgstr ""

#: ../../ignis/overview.rst:25
msgid ""
"The results of an Ignis experiment are passed to the Fitters module where"
" they are analyzed and fit according to the physics model describing the "
"experiment. Fitters can plot the data plus fit and output a list of "
"parameters."
msgstr ""

#: ../../ignis/overview.rst:31
msgid "Filters"
msgstr ""

#: ../../ignis/overview.rst:33
msgid ""
"For certain Ignis experiments, the fitters can output a Filter object. "
"Filters can be used to mitigate errors in other experiments using the "
"calibration results of an Ignis experiment."

msgid "Ignis Organization"
msgstr ""

#: ../../ignis/overview.rst:40
msgid ""
"The Ignis repository is grouped into the types of experiments that can be"
" performed: characterization, verification and mitigation."
msgstr ""

#: ../../ignis/overview.rst:45
msgid "Characterization"
msgstr ""

#: ../../ignis/overview.rst:47
msgid ""
"Characterization experiments are designed to measure parameters in the "
"system such as noise parameters (T1, T2*, T2), Hamiltonian parameters "
"such as the ZZ interaction rate and control errors in the gates."
msgstr ""

#: ../../ignis/overview.rst:52
msgid "Verification"
msgstr ""

#: ../../ignis/overview.rst:54
msgid ""
"Verification experiments are designed to verify gate and small circuit "
"performance. Verification includes state and process tomography, quantum "
"volume and randomized benchmarking (RB). These experiments provide the "
"information to determine performance metrics such as the gate fidelity."
msgstr ""

#: ../../ignis/overview.rst:60
msgid "Mitigation"
msgstr ""

#: ../../ignis/overview.rst:62
msgid ""
"Mitigation experiments run calibration circuits that are analyzed to "
"generate mitigation routines that can be applied to arbitrary sets of "
"results run on the same backend. Ignis code will generate a list of "
"circuits that run calibration measurements. The results of these "
"measurements will be processed by a Fitter and will output a Filter than "
"can be used to apply mitigation to other results."
