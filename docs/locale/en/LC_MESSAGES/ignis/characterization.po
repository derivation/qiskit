"To generate coherence circuits, call the functions ``t1_circuits``, "
"``t2_circuits``, and  ``t2star_circuits``. These circuits contain blocks "
"of identity gates (``id``) between particular gates depending on the "
"experiment. The user specifies a list with the number of identity gates "
"for each experiment; the list must be in ascending order. The length of "
"the ``id`` gate is backend dependent and the user must provide that time "
"(``gate_time``) to these functions. For each experiment the user also "
"specifies a list of qubits; identical experiments will occur in parallel "
"on these qubits. Only these qubits are measured and the results are "
"mapped to a classical register of size ``len(qubits)`` (the first qubit "
"specified is mapped to the first bit of the classical register, etc.). "

"``QuantumCircuit``), and a list of delay times indicating the total time "
