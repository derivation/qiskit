"In 2018 we worked on formalizing the backends and user flow in Qiskit "
"Terra. The basic idea is as follows: the user designs a quantum circuit "
"and then, through a set of transpiler passes, rewrites the circuit to run"
" on different backends with different optimizations. We also introduced "
"the concept of a *provider*, whose role is to supply backends for the "
"user to run quantum circuits on. The provider API we have defined at "
"version one supplies a set of schemas to verify that the provider and its"
" backends are Terra-compatible."

"Aqua is an open-source library of quantum algorithms and applications, "

"Quantum Kernel and Variational algorithms, suitable for supervised "

"such as optimizers, variational forms, oracles, Quantum Fourier "
"Transforms, feature maps, multiclass classification extension algorithms,"
" uncertainty problems, and random distributions. As a framework for "
"quantum applications, Aqua provides support for Chemistry (released "
