"The ``plot_histogram()`` has a few options to adjust the output graph. "
"The first option is the ``legend`` kwarg. This is used to provide a label"
" for the executions. It takes a list of strings use to label each "
"execution’s results. This is mostly useful when plotting multiple "
"execution results in the same histogram. The ``sort`` kwarg is used to "
"adjust the order the bars in the histogram are rendered. It can be set to"
" either ascending order with ``asc`` or descending order with ``dsc``. "
"The ``number_to_keep`` kwarg takes an integer for the number of terms to "
"show, the rest are grouped together in a single bar called rest. You can "
"adjust the color of the bars with the ``color`` kwarg which either takes "
"a string or a list of strings for the colors to use for the bars for each"
" execution. You can adjust whether labels are printed above the bars or "
"not with the ``bar_labels`` kwarg. The last option available is the "
"``figsize`` kwarg which takes a tuple of the size in inches to make the "
"output figure."
