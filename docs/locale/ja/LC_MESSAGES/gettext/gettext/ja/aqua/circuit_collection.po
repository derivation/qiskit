"algorithms and applications. The gates can be enabled by corresponding "

msgstr ""

#: ../../../aqua/circuit_collection.rst:19
msgid ""
"The *Multiple-Control Toffoli (mct)* gate, as the name suggests, is a "
"generalization of the traditional Toffoli gate s.t. one target qubit is "
"controlled by an arbitrary number of control qubits for a NOT (`x`) "
"operation. The MCT gate can be used as the building block for "
"implementing various different quantum algorithms, such as Grover's "
"search."

"For the different numbers 0, 1, 2, … of controls, we have corresponding "
"quantum gates ``x``, ``cx``, ``ccx``, ... The first three are basic/well-"
"known quantum gates. In Aqua, ``mct`` provides support for arbitrary "
"numbers of controls, in particular, 3 or above."

msgid ""
"Currently four different implementation strategies are included: *basic*,"
" *basic-dirty-ancilla*, *advanced*, and *noancilla*. The basic mode "
"employs a textbook implementation, where a series of ``ccx`` Toffoli "
"gates are linked together in a ``V`` shape to achieve the desired "
"Multiple-Control Toffoli operation. This mode requires :math:`n-2` "
"ancillary qubits, where :math:`n` is the number of controls. The basic-"
"dirty-ancilla mode is the same as the basic mode except that it allows "
"using dirty ancillary qubits, whereas the basic mode requires clean "
"ancillae. For the advanced mode, the ``cccx`` and ``ccccx`` operations "
"are achieved without needing ancillary qubits. Multiple-Control Toffoli "
"operations for higher number of controls (5 and above) are implemented "
"recursively using these lower-number-of-control cases. For the noancilla "
"mode, no ancillary qubits are needed even for higher number of controls. "
"This uses a technique of spliting multiple-control Toffoli operations, "
"which is efficient up to 8 controls but gets inefficient in the number of"
" required basic gates for values above. This technique relies on "
"``mcu1``, see :ref:`mcux` for more information."

msgid ""
"Toffoli gates are helpful in implementing various other quantum circuits,"
" including the Multiple-Control Toffoli gates discussed above. However, "
"the usage of Toffoli gates might incur high costs in terms of circuit "
"depth depending on the particular implementations selected. One approach "
"that has been studied to mitigate this problem is the use of Toffoli "
"gates *up to a relative phase*, for example, as discussed in `this paper "
"<https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.03273>`__. In Aqua, two such Relative-Phase "
"Toffoli gates are provided, the 2-Control ``rccx`` and the 3-Control "
"``rcccx``. Upon import, both can be directly invoked from QuantumCircuit "
"objects similar to the traditional Toffoli ``ccx`` gate."

"The *Multiple-Control Rotation (mcu)* gates, implements a U1 (`u1`) and a"

"parameter, whereas the MCU3 operation takes three for arbitrary "
"rotations. No ancillary qubits are needed. It is efficiently implemented "

" ancillary qubits for the same strategy. The difference is due to the "
"fact that in ``mct`` the chain ends with a single ``ccx`` writing on the "
