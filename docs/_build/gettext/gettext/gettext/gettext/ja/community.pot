#: ../../../community.rst:11
msgid "The Qiskit base provider is an entity that provides access to a group of different backends (for example, backends available through IBM Q). It interacts with those backends to do many things: find out which ones are available, retrieve an instance of a particular backend, get backend properties and configurations, and handling running and working with jobs."

msgid "Circuit Optimization"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../community.rst:45
msgid "Circuit optimization is at the heart of making quantum computing feasible on actual hardware. A central component of Qiskit is the transpiler, which is a framework for manipulating quantum circuits according to certain transformations (known as transpiler passes). The transpiler enables users to create customized sets of passes, orchestrated by a pass manager, to transform the circuit according to the rules specified by the passes. In addition, the transpiler architecture is designed for modularity and extensibility, enabling Qiskit users to write their own passes, use them in the pass manager, and combine them with existing passes. In this way, the transpiler architecture opens up the door for research into aggressive optimization of quantum circuits."
