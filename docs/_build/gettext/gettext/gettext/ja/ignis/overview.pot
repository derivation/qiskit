msgid "A framework for characterizing and mitigating noise in quantum circuits and devices."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../ignis/overview.rst:11
msgid "Ignis provides code for users to easily generate circuits for specific experiments given a minimal set of user input parameters. Ignis code contains three fundamental building blocks: circuits, fitters and filters."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../ignis/overview.rst:16
msgid "Circuits"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../ignis/overview.rst:18
msgid "The circuits module provides the code to generate the list of circuits for a particular Ignis experiment based on a minimal set of user parameters. These are then run on Terra or Aer."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../ignis/overview.rst:23
msgid "Fitters"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../ignis/overview.rst:25
msgid "The results of an Ignis experiment are passed to the Fitters module where they are analyzed and fit according to the physics model describing the experiment. Fitters can plot the data plus fit and output a list of parameters."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../ignis/overview.rst:31
msgid "Filters"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../ignis/overview.rst:33
msgid "For certain Ignis experiments, the fitters can output a Filter object. Filters can be used to mitigate errors in other experiments using the calibration results of an Ignis experiment."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../ignis/overview.rst:38
msgid "Ignis Organization"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../ignis/overview.rst:40
msgid "The Ignis repository is grouped into the types of experiments that can be performed: characterization, verification and mitigation."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../ignis/overview.rst:45
msgid "Characterization"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../ignis/overview.rst:47
msgid "Characterization experiments are designed to measure parameters in the system such as noise parameters (T1, T2*, T2), Hamiltonian parameters such as the ZZ interaction rate and control errors in the gates."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../ignis/overview.rst:52
msgid "Verification"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../ignis/overview.rst:54
msgid "Verification experiments are designed to verify gate and small circuit performance. Verification includes state and process tomography, quantum volume and randomized benchmarking (RB). These experiments provide the information to determine performance metrics such as the gate fidelity."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../ignis/overview.rst:60
msgid "Mitigation"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../ignis/overview.rst:62
msgid "Mitigation experiments run calibration circuits that are analyzed to generate mitigation routines that can be applied to arbitrary sets of results run on the same backend. Ignis code will generate a list of circuits that run calibration measurements. The results of these measurements will be processed by a Fitter and will output a Filter than can be used to apply mitigation to other results."
