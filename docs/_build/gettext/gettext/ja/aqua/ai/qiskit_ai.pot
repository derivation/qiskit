msgid "Qiskit Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a set of tools and algorithms that enable experimenting with AI problems via quantum computing. Aqua AI is the only end-to-end software stack that translates AI-specific problems into inputs for one of the :ref:`quantum-algorithms` in :ref:`aqua-library`, which in turn uses Qiskit Terra for the actual quantum computation on top a quantum simulator or a real quantum hardware device."

#: ../../../aqua/ai/qiskit_ai.rst:33
msgid "The :ref:`qsvm` algorithm applies to classification problems that require a feature map for which computing the kernel is not efficient classically. This means that the required computational resources are expected to scale exponentially with the size of the problem. QSVM uses a Quantum processor to solve this problem by a direct estimation of the kernel in the feature space. The method used falls in the category of what is called *supervised learning*, consisting of a *training phase* (where the kernel is calculated and the support vectors obtained) and a *test or classification phase* (where new labelless data is classified according to the solution found in the training phase)."

msgid "The :ref:`vqc` algorithm also applies to classification problems that require a feature map for which computing the kernel is not efficient classically. SVM Variational uses the variational method to solve such problems in a quantum processor.  Specifically, it optimizes a parameterized quantum circuit to provide a solution that cleanly separates the data."
