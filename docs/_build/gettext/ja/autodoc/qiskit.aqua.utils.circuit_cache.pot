msgid "A utility for caching and reparameterizing circuits, rather than compiling from scratch with each iteration. Note that if the circuit is transpiled aggressively such that rotation parameters cannot be easily mapped from the uncompiled to compiled circuit, caching will fail gracefully to standard compilation. This will be noted by multiple cache misses in the DEBUG log. It is generally safer to skip the transpiler (aqua_dict['backend']['skip_transpiler'] = True) when using caching."

msgid "A method for caching compiled qobjs by storing the compiled qobj and constructing a mapping array from the uncompiled operations in the circuit to the instructions in the qobj. Note that the \"qobjs\" list in the cache dict is a list of the cached chunks, each element of which contains a single qobj with as many experiments as is allowed by the execution backend. E.g. if the backend allows 300 experiments per job and the user wants to run 500 circuits, len(circuit_cache['qobjs']) == 2, len(circuit_cache['qobjs'][0].experiments) == 300, and len(circuit_cache['qobjs'][1].experiments) == 200."
