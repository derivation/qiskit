msgid "Uncertainty is present in most realistic applications, and often it is necessary to evaluate the behavior of a system under uncertain data. For instance, in finance, it is of interest to evaluate expected value or risk metrics of financial products that depend on underlying stock prices, economic factors, or changing interest rates. Classically, such problems are often evaluated using Monte Carlo simulation. However, Monte Carlo simulation does not converge very fast, which implies that large numbers of samples are required to achieve estimators of reasonable accuracy and confidence. In quantum computing, *amplitude estimation* can be used instead, which can lead to a quadratic speed-up. Thus, millions of classical samples could be replaced by a few thousand quantum samples."

msgid "*Amplitude estimation* is a derivative of *quantum phase estimation* applied to a particular operator :math:`A`. :math:`A` is assumed to operate on (n+1) qubits (+ possible ancillas) where the n qubits represent the uncertainty (random distribution :ref:`random_distribution`) and the last qubit is used to represent the (normalized) objective value as its amplitude. In other words, :math:`A` is constructed such that the probability of measuring a '1' in the objective qubit is equal to the value of interest. An implementation of an uncertainty problem is assumed to provide a dictionary with parameter, particularly containing the index of the qubit used for the objective:"
