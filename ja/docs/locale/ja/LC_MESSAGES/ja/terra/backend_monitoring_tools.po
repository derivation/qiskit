msgid "Tracking Job Status"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../terra/backend_monitoring_tools.rst:32
msgid "Many times a job(s) submitted to the IBM Q network can take a long time to process, e.g. jobs with many circuits and/or shots, or may have to wait in queue for other users. In situations such as these, it is beneficial to have a way of monitoring the progress of a job, or several jobs at once. As of Qiskit ``0.6+`` it is possible to monitor the status of a job in a Jupyter notebook, and also in a Python script (version ``0.7+``)."

The job will be monitored in a separate thread, allowing you to continue to work in the notebook.

For example, we have found the least busy backend, but do not know if this is the best backend with respect to gate errors, topology etc. It is possible to get detailed information for a single backend by calling ``backend_monitor``:"
