msgid "This tutorial shows how to use the Qiskit Aer™ ``noise.device`` module to automatically generate a noise model for an IBM Q™ hardware device, and use this model to do noisy simulation of ``QuantumCircuits`` to study the effects of errors which occur on real devices."

msgid "Note that these automatic models are only a highly simplified approximation of the real errors that occur on actual devices. The study of quantum errors on real devices is an active area of research and we discuss the Qiskit Aer tools for configuring more detailed noise models in another notebook."

We may get the properties of the backend using the ``properties`` method, the information in the returned ``BackendProperties`` object will be used to automatically generate a noise model for the device that can be used by the Qiskit Aer ``QasmSimulator``. We will also want to get the ``coupling_map`` for the device from its ``configuration`` to use when compiling circuits for simulation to most closely mimic the gates that will be executed on a real device"

msgid "You might notice that the counts returned in the above histogram don't look exactly like our simulation. This is because the real errors that happen on a device can be very complicated, and characterizing them to create acurate models is an active area of quantum computing research. The *basic device noise model* we used for our simulation is a simplified error model that only takes into account *local* errors occuring on the qubits participating in each individual gate, and treats the erors as a relaxation process combined with an error operation which acts to randomize the state of the qubit with some probability *p* (the depolarizing probability). While this model is an approximation, due to its simplicity it is a useful starting point for studying the effects of noise on quantum computations."
